Tracerlib is a set of utilities to make tracing Python code easier.

It provides ``TracerManager``, which can allow multiple trace functions to
coexist. It can easily be enabled and disabled, either manually or as a
context manager in a with statement.

``Tracer`` classes make handling the different trace events much easier.

::

    class TraceExceptions(Trace):
        def trace_exception(self, func_name, exctype, value, tb):
            print "Saw an exception: %r" % (value,)

And, a helper class ``FrameInspector`` which wraps a frame and makes it
trivial to inspect the function name and arguments the function had been
called with.

::

    inspector = FrameInspector(sys._getframe())

    print "Called", inspector.func_name
    print "args:", inspector.args
    print "kwargs:", inspector.kwargs
